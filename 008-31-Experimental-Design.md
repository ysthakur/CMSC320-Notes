## Ways to get data

1. Observational studies
2. Experiments
3. Synthetic

### Observational studies

Kinds of observational studies:

- Cross-sectional - Look at data in a single point in time
- Retrospective (case control) - Looking at studies of events in the past
- Prospective (aka longitudinal or cohort)
  - Follow group around and observe closely
  - High dropout rates

#### Surveys (kind of observational study)

Issues:

- Wording of questions can introduce bias
- Ordering of questions
- Convenience samples/self-selected samples
- Desire of respondents to please
- Confidentiality concerns may influence response
- Non-response bias

### Experiments

- Observe effects on subjects after the application of some treatment
- Might want to compare a treatment versus a control or multiple treatments
- The more variables you can control for, the better your experiment
  - Want the control to be as close to the experiment group as possible, except for the thing you're testing

## Fundamental Rule of Data Collection

Your data must be representative of the population you want to study
