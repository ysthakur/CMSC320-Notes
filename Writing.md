Covered in lecture on 10/3

- Put the most important stuff at the top, so that if someone stops reading at some point, they’ll have gotten as much information as possible:
    - Start with crucial information
    - Then supporting details
    - Then background information
- Avoid writing in first person
    - Prefer passive voice
    - If need active voice, use “we” instead of “I”
- Remove anything that doesn’t contribute anything, be brief
    - Remove useless adverbs/intensifiers
