8. Present

## Class Imbalance

[Class Imbalance](<Class Imbalance.md>)

## Models

- [KNN](KNN.md)
- [Decision Trees](<Decision Trees.md>)
- [Naive Bayes](<Naive Bayes.md>)
- [SVMs](SVMs.md)
- [Random Forests](<Random Forests.md>)
- Neural Networks can also be used for classification tasks, work well on unstructured data
	- However, **not generally well suited for classification**

## Training classifiers with sklearn

[sklearn for classification](<sklearn for classification.md>)
