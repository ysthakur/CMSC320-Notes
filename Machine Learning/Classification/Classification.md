3. Clean data
4. Feature engineer
5. Train
6. Test
7. Iterate
8. Present

## Class Imbalance

[Class Imbalance](Class%20Imbalance.md)

## Models

- [KNN](KNN.md)
- [Decision Trees](Decision%20Trees.md)
- [Naive Bayes](Naive%20Bayes.md)
- [SVMs](SVMs.md)
- [Random Forests](Random%20Forests.md)
- Neural Networks can also be used for classification tasks, work well on unstructured data
	- However, **not generally well suited for classification**

## Training classifiers with sklearn
