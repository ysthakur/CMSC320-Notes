## Classification Process

1. Acquire data
2. Explore data
3. Clean data
4. Feature engineer
5. Train
6. Test
7. Iterate
8. Present

## Models

- [K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)](K-Nearest%20Neighbors%20(KNN).md)
- [Decision Trees](Decision%20Trees.md)
- [Naive Bayes](Naive%20Bayes.md)
- [Support Vector Machines](Support%20Vector%20Machines.md)
- [Random Forests](Random%20Forests.md)
- Neural Networks can also be used for classification tasks, work well on unstructured data
	- However, **not generally well suited for classification**
