## Classification Process

1. Acquire data
2. Explore data
3. Clean data
4. Feature engineer
5. Train
6. Test
7. Iterate
8. Present

## Models

- [[K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)]]
- [[Decision Trees]]
- [[Naive Bayes]]
- [[Support Vector Machines]]
- [[Random Forests]]
- Neural Networks can also be used for classification tasks, work well on unstructured data
	- However, **not generally well suited for classification**
