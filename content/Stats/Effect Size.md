**Effect size** tells you how meaningful the relationship between variables or the difference between groups is

Why use effect size?

- **Practical significance** (effect size) shows that the effect is large enough to be meaningful in the real world
- Statistical significance (p-value) only shows that an effect exists in a study
	- Statistical significance alone can be misleading because influenced by sample size
	- Increasing sample size makes it more likely to find statistically significant effect
- In contrast, effect size is independent of sample size

One measure of effect size is [Pearson's Correlation Coefficient](Pearson's%20Correlation%20Coefficient.md)

Calculate effect size before doing hypothesis tests:
- Knowing the expected effect size lets you figure out the minimum sample size you need for enough statistical power to detect an effect of that size
