## Central Limit Theorem

If you have a distribution, such as rolling dice (uniform distribution), and you
repeatedly sample that and make a new distribution from the means of those samples,
then that new distribution will eventually approach a normal distribution with a
sufficiently large sample size.

Useful because if you have two funky-looking distributions, you can sample them a
bunch of times, and now you have two nice normal distributions that you can compare.
